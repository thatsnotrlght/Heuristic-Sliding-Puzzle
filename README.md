# Heuristic-Sliding-Puzzle
This web-based application allows users to upload any image and converts it into a playable 8-puzzle sliding game. The application features an intelligent AI solver powered by the A* search algorithm that can find and display the optimal solution step-by-step. Our goal was to make sure that we could upload any image and cut it into 8 pieces. With an “empty” box made for switching and allowing the pieces to move. With the help of the A* search algorithm we were able to achieve the shortest path to solving the puzzle. Our Front-End was built using only HTML, CSS, and JS for the Back-end and Algorithm. We decided to use the Manhattan Distance Heuristic rational search because we can move horizontally and vertically along the 3x3 grid layout.
